## Comparing two algorithms for solving tridiagonal linear systems. 

1. The Cholesky Algorithm for Tridiagnonal
For a positive definite and symmetric matrix, $A$ in $R^{n\times n}$, and a right-hand term $b$ in $R^{n\times 1}$, this algorithm exploits the tridiagonal structure of matrix, $A$ to solve the linear system $Ax = b$.
